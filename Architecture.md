## **Description:**

This class diagram provides an overview of the primary entities in the BookNow application: `User`, `Restaurant`, `Reservation`, `Table`, and `Review`. Each entity represents a core component of the system, with essential attributes, constructors, and methods that enable interactions within the application.

### **PLEASE NOTE:**
This is a high-level overview of the attributes, constructors, and methods for each entity. These serve as an initial blueprint and are subject to modification when 
implementing the actual logic. Adjustments, additions, or removals will be made during development, depending on real-world use cases and business logic. The goal 
here is to establish the structural framework, while detailed implementation will evolve as the project progresses. If for any reason you were cross checking and happen to see that the code
is different from what's on here that means a changed happened and have not been updated. 
If Diagram doesn't show on github no idea. Tried trouble shooting can't fix. Working fine on intellij. Look in Diagrams folder for Diagrams.
Also please note and understand that the current initial diagrams may not match the latest version of the code, as they havenâ€™t been updated yet. It's complicated when you lack experience and have to redo things multiple just to get what you want.
We're planning to update the diagrams once everything is finalized. We initially thought things were on track, but adjustments were necessary along the way.

# BookNow System Architecture

The BookNow system follows the `Model-View-Controller` (MVC) architecture, with additional `DAO`, `Service` and `Utils` layers for better modularity, encapsulation, and code maintainability.
Each layer serves a specific role in the application, facilitating interactions between the user interface, business logic, and data access.


**Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture. 
- The system is structured with three primary layers: **Models**, **Views**, and **Controllers**.

### **Models**:
The **Model** layer represents the core entities of the system. 
 - Model is already in Diagram 1

### **Views**:
The **View** layer consists of the user interface (UI) for interacting with the system. These are defined using JavaFX and FXML files:
- **LoginView**: UI for users to log in.
- **CreateAccountView**: UI for new users to create an account.
- **BookNowView**: Main UI for searching restaurants and creating reservations.
- **ReservationView**: UI where users can view and manage their reservations.
- **CreateReviewView**: UI where user create their review.
- **ReviewView**: UI where users can view and manage their reviews.

### **Controllers:**
The Controller layer acts as the intermediary between the UI (view) and the backend logic, handling user inputs, managing interactions with services, and updating the UI accordingly. Each controller in the BookNow system serves a distinct role within the application, managing specific tasks and features.

## Additional Layers

## DAO (Data Access Object)

The DAO layer abstracts and encapsulates all interactions with the database, providing a way for services to perform CRUD operations. Each DAO class manages data retrieval and storage for a specific entity.

### Core DAO Classes

- **UserDAO**: Manages database operations related to users, such as login and account creation.
- **RestaurantDAO**: Handles retrieval and storage of restaurant information.
- **ReservationDAO**: Manages reservation records, including creation, retrieval, and cancellation.
- **TableDAO**: Handles database operations related to tables, like checking availability.
- **ReviewDAO**: Manages CRUD operations for reviews, including retrieving and submitting reviews.

## Service Layer

The Service layer contains business logic that intermediates between Controllers and DAOs. Services manage application logic, enforce rules, and perform data transformations where needed. This layer allows Controllers to request higher-level operations without handling complex database interactions directly.

### Core Service Classes

- **UserService**: Manages user-related operations, such as authentication and account management.
- **RestaurantService**: Handles business logic related to restaurants, like fetching available restaurants and cuisines.
- **ReservationService**: Manages reservation-related logic, including availability checks, reservation creation, and cancellation.
- **TableService**: Handles table-related operations, including seat capacity checks and table reservations.
- **ReviewService**: Manages review-related functionality, such as fetching and submitting user reviews.
- **BookNowFacadeService**: A facade service that coordinates interactions across multiple services to simplify complex tasks for controllers.

## Utility Classes

The Utils package provides helper classes to support common tasks, such as database connections, UI alerts, and scene transitions.

### Core Utility Classes

- **DBConnection**: Manages database connection settings and establishes connections for DAOs.
- **UIUtil**: Contains utility methods for displaying alerts, managing scene transitions, and populating UI components.
- **RestaurantUIManager**: Manages restaurant-specific UI tasks, such as displaying restaurant lists and availability views.
- **ReservationUIManager**: Manages the UI for displaying and managing reservations.
- **ReviewUIManager**: Manages the UI for displaying and managing reviews.

# Interaction Flow Example

## 1. Register

**Actor**: Customer

1. The customer opens the Create New Account page.
2. Inputs their username, password, and confirmPassword.
3. Clicks the "Create Account" button.
4. `CreateNewAccountController` calls:
  - `UserService.validateAndCreateAccount()` to validate the inputs:
    - Ensures all fields are filled.
    - Validates password confirmation and username uniqueness.
5. If validation passes:
  - `UserService.validateAndCreateAccount()` calls `UserDAO.createAccount()` to save the new user in the database.
  - The system displays a success message and redirects the customer to the login page.

## 2. Login

**Actor**: Customer

1. The customer opens the Login page.
2. Inputs their username and password.
3. Clicks the "Login" button.
4. `LoginController` calls:
  - `UserService.login()` to validate credentials:
    - Checks username and password against the database using `UserDAO.login()`.
5. If credentials are valid:
  - `LoginController` sets `UIUtil.USER` to the username.
  - Redirects the customer to the BookNow main page.

## 3. Search Restaurants

**Actor**: Customer

1. On the main page, the customer selects:
  - Location from the `locationComboBox`.
  - Cuisine Type from the `cb_cuisineType`.
  - Date using the `checkInDate` picker.
  - Guests (adults and children) from `cb_adults` and `cb_children`.
2. Clicks the "Search" button.
3. `BookNowController` validates inputs and calls:
  - `RestaurantService.getAvailableRestaurants()` to fetch matching restaurants from the database.
4. Results are displayed dynamically in the `restaurantListVBox` using `RestaurantUIManager.populateRestaurantListVBox()`.

2. **BookNowController** retrieves inputs and validates them:
  - Location and cuisine type are not empty.
  - Date is valid (not in the past).
  - Guest count is provided.
3. If inputs are valid:
  - **BookNowController** calls `RestaurantService.getAvailableRestaurants(location, cuisineType, guestCount, date)`:
    - **RestaurantService** calls `RestaurantDAO.getAvailableRestaurants(location, cuisineType, guestCount, date)` to query the database for matching restaurants.
    - **RestaurantDAO** returns a list of matching restaurants.
    - **RestaurantService** returns the list to **BookNowController**.
  - **BookNowController** calls `RestaurantUIManager.populateRestaurantListVBox(restaurants)` to dynamically display the results in the UI.
