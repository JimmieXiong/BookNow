# BookNow

BookNow is a restaurant reservation platform to simulate a booking process for customers. With an intuitive
user interface, users can search for restaurants by selecting a location, cuisine type, check-in date, and the number of
guests (adults and children). Once users have found their preferred restaurant, they can check available time slots and
easily make a reservation.

The application also allows users to view and manage their current reservations, including options to cancel bookings.
Additionally, customers can leave reviews and view their previous feedback on restaurants theyâ€™ve visited.
